# PHP-Petwatch
This is a website based on lost pets that can be logged into a website
This is a university assignment I had been given and it is not 100% functional due to being on such a short deadline but this is what I could get done before the while learning PhP from scratch.
PetWatch is a Java application designed to help communities reunite lost pets with their owners.
Users who find a lost pet can post a listing with important details such as the pet’s type, name, and location.
Anyone can browse lost-pet listings without an account, while registered users can create new posts.

User Accounts
Users can create an account with a unique username and password.
Account required only for posting new lost-pet reports.
Browsing listings is open to all users—no login required.

Lost Pet Listings
Reported pets include:
Pet type (e.g., dog, cat, bird)
Pet name (if known)
Location found

Data Management
User accounts and lost-pet posts are stored using SQL databases
Each listing and user are assigned unique IDs for easy reference.

Technologies Used
PhP (Core Language)
HTML
SQL
css

To run this you would need to run it under "localhost:8000"
I created this using PhPStorm and was testing/running it using the built-in feature
